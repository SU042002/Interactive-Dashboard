# Implementation of the Clinic Design

Part 2 of the 3rd year coursework for the module "Large Scale Data Driven Application".

## Problem
Missed healthcare appointments, or no-shows, are a costly issue that disrupt clinic workflows, waste resources, and delay patient care. These missed appointments increase the workload for staff and reduce healthcare facility revenue. Factors influencing no-shows include patient demographics, medical conditions, socio-economic background, and lack of reminders. Patients with chronic conditions, such as hypertension or diabetes, are at higher risk of no-shows, particularly affecting critical healthcare services where timely care is essential.

To address these challenges, this coursework involves developing a web-based platform using RDBMS, MongoDB, and PHP. The system analyzes data on patient demographics, appointment history, reminders, and health conditions to identify no-show patterns. Interactive dashboards provide healthcare providers with real-time insights into no-show rates by neighbourhood, age group, medical condition, and reminder effectiveness to help mitigate no-shows.

**This coursework will use MongoDB and web technologies**

## Tasks
1. - [x]  Design and Layout of the Dashboard
   
You need to create an intuitive, user-friendly interface that allows users to select various parameters (e.g., patient demographics, gender, appointment details, or medical conditions) to generate insights. Ensure the dashboard is responsive, easy to navigate, and interactive. Design it to incorporate diverse visual elements, such as charts, tables, and filters, to enhance the user experience and present data effectively.

2. - [x]  Database Connectivity
   
Connect the dashboard to the MongoDB database, ensuring reliable and efficient data retrieval. Configure connection settings to enable seamless interaction between the dashboard and the database, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.

3. - [x]  Implementation of Query Functionality

Develop features that allow users to run predefined queries on the MongoDB database. Ensure users have the ability to filter and customise these queries to explore various aspects of the dataset, such as demographic insights and appointment trends, for a more tailored and insightful analysis.

4. - [x]  User Interaction Features

Implement interactive elements, such as dropdown menus, sliders, and date pickers, to allow users to refine their queries and explore the data effectively. Include options for users to compare different metrics, such as no-show rates by demographic factors.

5. - [x]  Data Visualisation Integration

Incorporate data visualisation libraries (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js, or others of your choice) to present query results in a visually engaging way. Design dynamic visualisations that update in real-time based on user inputs and selected parameters, providing an interactive and insightful experience..

6. - [x]  Testing and Quality Assurance

Conduct thorough testing of the dashboard to ensure all functionalities work as intended. Verify that data visualisations accurately represent the underlying data and respond correctly to user interactions.

(This can basically be skipped and I can move on to the final section.)

This is just testing if the shit works and confirming it works which I have already done while developing the program.

7. - [x]  Documentation and User Guide

Provide technical documentation outlining the dashboardâ€™s architecture and how it connects to the MongoDB database. Create comprehensive documentation detailing how to use the dashboard, including instructions for executing queries and interpreting visualisations. Include evidence of testing various features by adding relevant screenshots, demonstrating that the functionality works as expected.
